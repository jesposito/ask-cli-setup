## Alexa Skill Building - Prerequisites

Alexa provides capabilities, or **skills**, that enable customers to add new interactivity to their devices. There are now tens of thousands of skills from companies like Starbucks, Uber, and Capital One as well as other innovative designers and developers.

Building a skill is easy, using the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) - a collection of self-service APIs, tools, documentation, and code samples that makes it fast and easy for you to add skills to Alexa. ASK enables designers, developers, and brands to build engaging skills and reach customers through the tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices. 

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up all the necessary resources to develop and publish Alexa Skills. These include:

* an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
* the AWS CLI tool
* an Amazon Developer Portal account
* the ASK CLI tool



#### Do you have an AWS Account?

If you already have AWS account that you would like to use, go straight to the AWS CLI setup, otherwise follow the guide and create a new account now.
